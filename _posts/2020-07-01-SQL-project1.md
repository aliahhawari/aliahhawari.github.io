# Database querying with SQL magic

SQL is one of the querying languages that I am enjoying learning. I am still a beginner at this and I thought I would use this space to practice and develop my skills. 

In this example, I will be using the XXX dataset. This dataset contains information about air quality data from around the world.

```python
def HelloWorld(): 
    print('Hello World!')
    
print(HelloWorld())
```

    Hello World!
    None


```python

```
