I am an experienced postdoctoral research analyst, with a passion in data science, demonstrated with degrees in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. A portfolio of transferable Technical & IT strengths evidenced with over four yearsâ€™ university interdisciplinary research and teaching experience in an academic setting. 

I aspire to help heads of data science in Pharma, Biotech and Agri-Industries with insights, strategy for growth and trends in markets by data analysis and interpretation.

I love working on projects together, so feel free to reach out for collaboration!
